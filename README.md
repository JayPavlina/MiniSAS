This is an iOS game I was working on for a little while in 2013. It was going to be a turn-based 2D platformer with online multiplayer. I made it right after the first version of Swift was released, so the language has probably changed a lot since then. It had some integration with CloudKit, but I did not get very far on the project. I uploaded it to show that I have done some work with Swift in the past.
